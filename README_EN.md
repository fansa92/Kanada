- **Lyric Module**: Implements lyric matching, synchronized display, and support for external lyric displays. It is completed through a custom lyric parser and the `kanada_lyric_sender` plugin.
- **Metadata Module**: Responsible for obtaining music metadata, such as title, artist, and album cover. It is implemented through the `Metadata` class.
- **Settings Module**: Manages various user settings, such as lyric display, playback mode, and sound effects settings. It uses the `Settings` class to save and read settings information.

### Main Dependencies

- `kanada_lyric_sender`: Used for lyric sending and synchronization.
- `http`: Used for network requests, such as obtaining Netease Cloud Music playlist information and lyrics.
